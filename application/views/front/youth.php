                </p>

                <p>We are all just coming to terms with the fact that Nepal has been hit with massive, devastating
                    earthquake on 25th April’15. In this traumatic act of god; 8.1 million people have been vastly
                    affected according to a UN report. However, the true extent of the damage from the earthquake is
                    still unknown as reports keep filtering in from remote areas, some of which remain entirely cut-off.
                    It is not possible to make them forget about what has happened, but at least we can put out little
                    possible share to provide some possible relief to the needy.</p>

                <p>Now, all the teams involved in rescue work are getting back, as the survival of the people stuck is
                    not possible(if any). But as per UN report, relief operation will have to carry on for at least 3
                    months. An appeal is to do not stop your contribution, keep donating to the channels/organisation
                    you trust or are doing relief work in Nepal.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Under the banner, We also provided floods rehabilitation to Uttarakhand victims in 2013. We had a
                    tie-up with startup Room n House. We approached people in Dehradun, asked them to list their
                    properties on the startup site, and offered to rehabilitate the victims by giving them a place to
                    stay for initial few days. Through the collaboration, we were able to provide accommodation to 153
                    families. Through other means, we were able to provide shelter to 50 families more. This way, we
                    were able to rehabilitate flood victims for initial few days. Salaam Zindagi was the organization,
                    who protested against the VVIPs visits during the rescue operations which were causing delay in
                    rescue of the victims. Along with this initiative Salaam Zindagi requested to the Government with
                    the help Media to enable Private Chopper Services to all the needy, irrespective of any class, and
                    this intervention has produced the positive results.</p>
